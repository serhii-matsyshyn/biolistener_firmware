# BioListener Firmware

BioListener is based on ESP32 D1 MINI module (ESP-WROOM-32).  
BioListener uses PlatformIO and Arduino framework for easy and user-friendly code development, with the ability to use all open source developments of the Arduino Framework and easy integration for specific problems.  

At the moment, the following communication methods are supported:
- WiFi TCP real-time biosignals data transmittion to BrainFlow server.

The following communication methods can be added in future:
- Bluetooth, BLE real-time data transmittion support
- Offline mode with storage on SD card
- Unstable networks support mode
- Big Data IoT server for real time data capture and processing from hundreds of boards
