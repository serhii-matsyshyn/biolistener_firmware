# BioListener Firmware

**BioListener** is based on the **ESP32 D1 MINI** module (ESP-WROOM-32).

The firmware utilizes **PlatformIO** and the **Arduino framework** to enable easy and user-friendly code development. This setup provides seamless integration with open-source Arduino Framework developments and allows for easy adaptation to specific use cases.

### Currently Supported Communication Methods
- **WiFi TCP**: Real-time biosignal data transmission to the **BrainFlow server**.

### Planned Communication Methods
The following features are planned for future updates:
- **Bluetooth / BLE**: Real-time data transmission over Bluetooth / BLE support.
- **Offline Mode**: Data storage on **SD card**.
- **Unstable Networks Support**: Mode to handle unreliable network connections.
- **Big Data IoT Server**: Real-time data capture and processing from many boards.
